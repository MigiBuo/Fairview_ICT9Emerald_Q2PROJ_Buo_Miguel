            		<td class="text-center align-middle">There are 3 main ingredients for the meal. Tapa refers to beef tapa. The rice can either be plain or fried. It is ideal to use leftover rice because it is less likely to stick with each other. Fry the eggs based on your preference. <td>
            		<td class="text-center align-middle"><p>Beef is boiled in its marinade with the addition of water in order to make it tender. Cooking oil is added in the process. Once the liquid completely evaporates, the beef gets fried in the remaining oil. Frying using the remaining oil completes the beef tapa. Start cooking the rice by first browning the garlic. You can put oil and garlic in the pan at the same time and cook until the garlic turns light brown. Add half of the rice and then stir fry. This will give you enough room to blend the garlic and rice. Add remaining rice afterwards and continue to stir fry until well blended. Season with salt. The easiest to cook among the three components is the egg. Fry the eggs based on your preference.
